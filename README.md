## What is implemented
* Kill streaks system for humans
* Osprey [NOT USES]
* Lunge Zones (On maps: Resistance, Terminal, Underground) [NOT USES (MapClass.cs)]
* Anticamp system (If used MOAB or Juggernaut)
* AC130
* Light armor vest
* Advanced predator missile (missile launched from UAV) [NOT UESE]

## Bugs
* If you call more than 8 helicopter, the server will shut down (not a bug, just for now I'm too lazy to check for the number of helicopters in air)
